# Start the basic ULP RDMA kernel modules when RDMA hardware is detected (note
# the rdma-load-modules@.service is already before this target)

# Order after the standard network.target for compatibility with init.d
# scripts that order after networking - this will mean RDMA is ready too.
Before=network.target
# We do not order rdma-hw before basic.target, units for daemons that use RDMA
# have to manually order after rdma-hw.target
