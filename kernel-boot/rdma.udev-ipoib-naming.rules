# This is a sample udev rules file that demonstrates how to get udev to
# set the name of IPoIB interfaces to whatever you wish.  There is a
# 16 character limit on network device names though, so don't go too nuts
#
# Important items to note: ATTR{type}=="32" is IPoIB interfaces, and the
# ATTR{address} match must start with ?* and only reference the last 8
# bytes of the address or else the address might not match on any given
# start of the IPoIB stack
#
# Note: as of rhel7, udev is case sensitive on the address field match
# and all addresses need to be in lower case.
