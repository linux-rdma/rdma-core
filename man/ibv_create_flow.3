.PP
Each spec struct holds the relevant network layer parameters for matching. To enforce the match, the user sets a mask for each parameter.
.br
If the bit is set in the mask, the corresponding bit in the value should be matched.
.br
Note that most vendors support either full mask (all "1"s) or zero mask (all "0"s).
.br
.B Network parameters in the relevant network structs should be given in network order (big endian).

.SS Flow domains and priority
Flow steering defines the concept of domain and priority. Each domain represents an application that can attach a flow.
Domains are prioritized. A higher priority domain will always supersede a lower priority domain when their flow specifications overlap.
.br
.B IB verbs have the higher priority domain.
.br
In addition to the domain, there is priority within each of the domains.
A lower priority numeric value (higher priority) takes precedence over matching rules with higher numeric priority value (lower priority).
It is important to note that the priority value of a flow spec is used not only to establish the precedence of conflicting flow matches
but also as a way to abstract the order on which flow specs are tested for matches. Flows with higher priorities will be tested before flows with lower priorities.
.PP
.SS ibv_destroy_flow()
destroys the flow
.I flow_id\fR.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B ibv_create_flow()
returns a pointer to the flow, or NULL if the request fails. In case of an error, errno is updated.
.PP
.B ibv_destroy_flow()
returns 0 on success, or the value of errno on failure (which indicates the failure reason).
.SH "ERRORS"
.SS EINVAL
.B ibv_create_flow()
flow specification, QP or priority are invalid
.PP
.B ibv_destroy_flow()
flow_id is invalid
.SS ENOMEM
Couldn't create/destroy flow, not enough memory
.SS ENXIO
Device managed flow steering isn't currently supported
.SS EPERM
No permissions to add the flow steering rule
.SH "NOTES"
These verbs are available only for devices supporting
.br
IBV_DEVICE_MANAGED_FLOW_STEERING and only for QPs of Transport Service Type
.BR IBV_QPT_UD
or
.BR IBV_QPT_RAW_PACKET
