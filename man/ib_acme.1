.SH "DESCRIPTION"
ib_acme provides assistance configuring and testing the ib_acm service.
The first usage of the service will test that the ib_acm is running
and operating correctly.  The second usage model will automatically
create address and configuration files for the ib_acm service.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-f addr_format
Specifies the format of the src_addr and dest_addr parameters.  Valid
address formats are: 'i', 'n', and 'p', which indicate that the src_addr
and dest_addr parameters are ip addresses, system network names, or LIDs,
respectively.  If the -f option is omitted, ip addressing is assumed.
.TP
\-s src_addr
Specifies the local source address of the path to resolve.  The source
address can be an IP address, system network name, or LID, as indicated by
the addr_format option.
.TP
\-s dest_addr
Specifies the destination address of the path to resolve.  The destination
address can be an IP address, system network name, or LID, as indicated by
the addr_format option.
.TP
\-v
Indicates that the resolved path information should be verified with the
active IB SA.  Use of the -v option provides a sanity check that
resolved path information is usable given the current cluster configuration.
.TP
\-c
Instructs the ACM service to only returned information that currently resides
in its local cache.
.TP
\-A
With this option, the ib_acme utility automatically generates the address
configuration file acm_addr.cfg.  The generated file is
constructed using the system host name and any IP addresses that are
assigned to IPoIB device instances.
.TP
\-O
With this option, the ib_acme utility automatically generates the option
configuration file acm_opts.cfg.  The generated file is currently generated
using static information.
.TP
\-V
Enables verbose output.  When combined with -A or -O options, ib_acme will
display additional details, such as generated address information saved
to the acm_addr.cfg file.
.SH "NOTES"
The ib_acme utility performs two main functions.  With the -A and -O options,
it automatically generates address or options configuration files.  The
generated files are text based and may be edited.  These options are intended
to provide a simple way to configure address and option information on all
nodes on a cluster.
.P
The other function of the ib_acme utility is to test the ib_acm service,
including helping to verify that the service is usable given the current
cluster configuration.  The ib_acme utility can resolve IP addresses,
network names, or IB LIDs into a path record.  It can then compare that
path record against one obtained by the SA.  When used to test the
ib_acm service, the ib_acme utility has the side effect of loading the
ib_acm caches.
.P
Multiple, numerical destinations can be specified by adding brackets [] to
the end of a base destination name or address.  Users may specify a list of
numerical ranges inside the brackets using the following example as a
guide: node[1-3,5,7-8].  This will result in testing node1, node2, node3,
node5, node7, and node8.
