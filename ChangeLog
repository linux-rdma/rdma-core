    Handle 0B IO better.
    
    Allow num_sge == 0 to indicate a 0B IO.
    
    Also, for read, if length is 0 then create a valid 0B read request
    regardless of the user's specified lkey/rkey.  This avoids 0 stag
    connection terminations.

    zero context struct at allocation time (prep for additional context ops)
    
    The ibv_context structure will be getting additional ops, to be added at
    the end of the structure (and not as part of the existing ibv_context_ops
    structure).
    
    Reason: ibv_context_ops is declared directly as a member of ibv_context,
    and not as a pointer.  Binaries compiled with previous libibverbs
    versions will not be backwards compatible if we add new operations to
    ibv_context_ops, since fields following the ops structure will move.
    
    To enable adding new operations at the end of the existing ibv_context
    struct, all driver libraries MUST zero their context structure at
    allocation time, so that new ops will be NULL by default.

    Use the chelsio device number to determine the type of adapter.
    
    The existing code was using the sysfs files to obtain the adapter type
    or hw revision.  This method wasn't portable to older distros because
    it used sysfs entries not inserted by the rdma core, but rather by the
    PCI subsystem.  Further, these files don't exist in RHEL4u4! This code
    was implemented before it was known that the chelsio device numbers
    actually encode the hw revision.
    
    The simpler and portable solution is to just determine the hardware
    revision based on the device number.

    Update libcxgb3 for new libibverbs driver handling
    
    The latest libibverbs development tree changes how low-level drivers
    are found.  The driver must be in a shared object like
    libcxgb3-rdmav2.so in the ordinary library path, rather than
    infiniband/cxgb3.so as for libibverbs 1.0.  In addition, the driver
    must call ibv_register_driver() to pass its entry point to libibverbs,
    rather than exporting an ibv_driver_init() function.
    
    Since the current libcxgb3 tree is targeted only for libibverbs
    development trees and won't work with libibverbs 1.0, this patch
    changes libcxgb3 to work with the new libibverbs way of loading
    drivers without any autoconf tests.

    r9914: Poll fixes and T3B semantics for user mode.
    
    - Support T3B poll semantics
    - Support unsignaled sq wrs correctly
    - Support out of order read completions without stalling the entire cq
    
    The above changes were done by adding a SW SQ where out of order
    completions are stored until they become in-order, at which time they
    get flushed into the SW CQ.  This makes for a simplified overall poll
    and also supports unsignaled SQ WRs.
