    libcxgb4: unmap the correct udb/ugts address.
    
        The various db and gts variables holding the mapped bar2 pointer
        get incremented at creation time as a normal part of object creation.
        However this causes the wrong address to get unmapped when the object is
        destroyed.  The result is a mapping leak because the munmap() fails.
        So align them back to their proper page boundary when calling munmap().

    This commit is composed of a series of patches to enable T5 support.  I
    folded them into one commit for simplicity.  Plus intermittent patches
    caused problems/regressions/etc, so its cleaner to have 1 commit to enable
    the new device.

    flush bug can cause application crash
    
    This fixes a problem in the flush logic that could occur if the
    current position is near the end of the queue and the 'count' being
    retired plus this position was greater than the queue size. In this
    case the index wasn't being wrapped and the associated swcqe pointer
    would point past the end of the CQ.
    
    Asserts were added to check other possible wrap-error paths.
    
    This bug was causing mbw to occasionally crash when flushing the qp.

    Terminator HW always generates read response cqes.  We need to silently

    libcxgb4: return -ENOSYS in c4iw_resize_cq().
    
    I fixed a "bug" in c4iw_resize_cq() in an earlier commit which regressed
    us.  c4iw_resize_cq() was returning 0 always even though we don't support
    resizing the CQ.  So I change libcxgb4 to return whatever errno is
    returned by the kernel driver.   However, because the driver didn't set
    the uverbs capabilities for resize_cq, uverbs returned EINVAL.  The OMPI
    code checks for -ENOSYS and handles providers that don't support it.
    If, however, ibv_resize_cq() returns any other error, OMPI bails out.
    So we need to return -ENOSYS.
    
    I didn't see this error, however, running NP192 OMPI/IMB all night long.
    So it must only try to resize for small jobs and thus I missed the
    regression.

    Support variable sized work requests.
    
    T4 EQ entries are in multiples of 64B.  Currently the RDMA SQ and RQ
    use fixed sized entries composed of 4 EQ entries for the SQ and 2 EQ
    entries for the RQ.  For optimial latency with small IO, we need to
    change this so the HW only needs to DMA the EQ entries actually used by
    a given work request.
    
    Implementation:
    
    - add wq_pidx counter to track where we are in the EQ.  cidx/pidx are
    used for the sw sq/rq tracking and flow control.
    
    - the variable part of work requests is the SGL.  Add new functions to
    build the SGL and/or immediate data directly in the EQ memory wrapping
    when needed.
    
    - adjust the min burst size for the EQ contexts to 64B.

    Optimize cq overflow detection.
    
    1) save the timestamp flit in the cq when we consume a CQE
    
    2) always compare the saved flit with the previous entry flit when reading
    the next CQE entry.  If the flits don't compare, then we've overflowed.

commit ad7a3f8dea2873a3a600859cfe8eb10ad979ddb1
Author: Steve Wise <swise@opengridcomputing.com>

    Avoid CQ arm overflows.
    
    There are 2 limits that need to be taken into account when arming the CQ.
    1) the GTS register limits the delta idx to <= M_CIDXINC.
    2) T4 HW limits it to < cq size.
    
    Update t4_arm_cq() to account for these limits.

    Poll fixes.
    
    - when synthesizing CQEs for the SWCQ, always use SQ QID.
    - when flushing, ignore target side read response errors.

Date:   Thu May 6 17:24:07 2010 -0500

    Fix CQ overflow detection.
    
    CQ overflow detection needs to read the gen bit and the timestamp in
    one read operation.  Otherwise false overflows can result.
