Introduction
============

libcxgb3 is a userspace driver for the Chelsio T3 iWARP RNIC.  It works
as a plug-in module for libibverbs that allows programs to use Chelsio
RNICs directly from userspace.  See the libibverbs package for more
information.

Using libcxgb3
===================

libcxgb3 will be loaded and used automatically by programs linked with
libibverbs.  The iw_c2 kernel module must be loaded for Chelsio RNIC
devices to be detected and used.

Supported Hardware
==================

libcxgb3 supports the Chelsio T3 family of adapters.
