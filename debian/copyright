 .
 On Debian systems, the full text of the GNU General Public License
 version 2 can be found in the file `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2'.

License: CC0
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
 ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
 infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
 redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
 including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
 to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
 production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
 greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
 others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
 additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
 Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
 and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
 publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
 effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to,
 the following:
 .
     the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 and translate a Work; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
 performer(s); publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
 likeness depicted in a Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in
 regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; rights
 protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
 database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European
 Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of
 databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended
 or successor version of such directive); and other similar, equivalent or
 corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty,
 and any national implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
 the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
 shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
 by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
 is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
 transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
 license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
 all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
 law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
 future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
 whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
 purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date
 CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
 reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
 partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
 License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
 exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
 or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
 Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
     No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.  Affirmer offers
 the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
 concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
 without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
 particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
 defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
 discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
 Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may
 apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
 responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other
 rights required for any use of the Work.  Affirmer understands and acknowledges
 that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
 obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.
