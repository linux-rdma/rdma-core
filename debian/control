Package: ibacm
Architecture: any
Depends: lsb-base (>= 3.2-14~), ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: InfiniBand Communication Manager Assistant (ACM)
 The IB ACM implements and provides a framework for name, address, and
 route (path) resolution services over InfiniBand.
 It is intended to address connection setup scalability issues running
 MPI applications on large clusters.  The IB ACM provides information
 needed to establish a connection, but does not implement the CM protocol.
 A primary user of the ibacm service is the librdmacm library.

Package: ibverbs-utils
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Examples for the libibverbs library
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 This package contains useful libibverbs1 example programs such as
 ibv_devinfo, which displays information about InfiniBand devices.

Package: librdmacm1

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Library for managing RDMA connections
 librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable
 connected and unreliable datagram transfers when using RDMA adapters.
 It provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
 code can be used for both InfiniBand and iWARP adapters.  The
 interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
 semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
 transfers are message-based.
 .
 librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
 and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
 provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
 transfer data.
