ibdiscover.pl uses a topology file create by ibnetdiscover and a discover.map
file which the network administrator creates which indicates the nodes
to be expected and a ibdiscover.topo file which is the expected connectivity

the changes to stdout. The network administrator can choose to replace
the "old" topo file with the new one or certain changes in.

The syntax of the ibdiscover.map file is:

<nodeGUID>|port|"Text for node"|<NodeDescription from ibnetdiscover format>

8f10403960558|2|"HCA 1"|# MT23108 InfiniHost Mellanox Technologies

The syntax of the old and new topo files (ibdiscover.topo and
ibdiscover.topo.new) are:

<LocalPort>|<LocalNodeGUID>|<RemotePort>|<RemoteNodeGUID>

e.g.

10|5442ba00003080|1|8f10400410015

These topo files are produced by the ibdiscover.pl tool.
