.SH NAME
iwpmd \- port mapping services for iWARP.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
\fIiwpmd\fR
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The iWARP Port Mapper Daemon provides a user space service (iwpmd) for the
iWarp drivers to claim tcp ports through the standard socket interface.
.P
The kernel space support for the port mapper is part of the iw_cm module.
The ib_core module includes netlink support, which is used by the port
mapper clients to exchange messages with iwpmd. Both modules iw_cm and
ib_core need to be loaded in order for the libiwpm service to start
successfully.
.SH "IWARP PORT MAPPING DETAILS"
The iWARP Port Mapper implementation is based on the port mapper
specification section in the Sockets Direct Protocol:
http://www.rdmaconsortium.org/home/draft-pinkerton-iwarp-sdp-v1.0.pdf
.P
Existing iWARP RDMA providers use the same IP address as the native
TCP/IP stack when creating RDMA connections.  They need a mechanism to
claim the TCP ports used for RDMA connections to prevent TCP port
collisions when other host applications use TCP ports.  The iWARP Port
Mapper provides a standard mechanism to accomplish this.  Without this
service it is possible for RDMA application to bind/listen on the same
port which is already being used by native TCP host application.  If
that happens the incoming TCP connection data can be passed to the
RDMA stack with error.
.P
The iWARP Connection Manager (port mapper client) sends to the IWPM
service the local IP address and TCP port it has received from the RDMA
application, when starting a connection.  The IWPM service performs
a socket bind from user space to get an available TCP port, called a
mapped port, and communicates it back to the client.  In that sense,
the IWPM service is used to map the TCP port, which the RDMA application
uses to any port available from the host TCP port space. The mapped ports
are used in iWARP RDMA connections to avoid collisions with native TCP
stack which is aware that these ports are taken. When an RDMA connection
using a mapped port is terminated, the client notifies the IWPM service,
which then releases the TCP port.
.P
The message exchange between iwpmd and the iWARP Connection Manager
(between user space and kernel space) is implemented using netlink
sockets.
